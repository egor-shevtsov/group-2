Gyms recommender

# Description of the project
Our app will help to find the best gym options for people with different priorities

Since "the best" is extremely vague and unspecific, we have to define the criteria that will make "the best" measurable
- Each user will be able to choose a specific location for which he/she/them want(s) to receive gyms recommendations both manually and automatically. 
- Each user will be able to specify a time interval for which the recommendation should be created in order to get the most precise possible travelling time and cost information. This will help users to get the options that are tailored to a specific situation (going to the gym from home, after work, anything imaginable)
- Each gym in the city will have a rating assigned to it based on the following parameters 
  - travelling time from the chosen location
  - travelling cost (public transport only) from the chosen location
  - membership's price
  - congestion rating of the gym
  - overall rating of the gym
- Each user will be able to define the personal importance of each aforementioned criterion
- Based on the provided information, the app will recommend the top 5 gyms that satisfy the set criteria the best. Each of these gyms will be shown on a Google Map as a result with respective data for all 5 parameters mentioned above

Every user will be able to create his/her/their own user account where all the previous requests will be shown in the history. Besides this, each logged-in user will have an opportunity to bookmark specific gyms in order to get notifications if any information regarding the favoured gyms changes.
Each anonymous and logged-in user will be able to rate the gym and the congestion of the gym in particular

Each gym account will be able to manage data related to the gyms that are attached to it, including membership price and working hours.

Before a certain gym account can have a gym attached to it and receives access to editing its data, an administrator must approve this binding

# 📝 Code of Conduct [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
As students, you are surely familiar with the minimum acceptable behaviour defined in [CODE OF CONDUCT FOR STUDENTS OF THE FACULTY OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ZAGREB](https://www.fer.hr/_download/repository/Kodeks_ponasanja_studenata_FER-a_procisceni_tekst_2016%5B1%5D.pdf), and additional instructions for teamwork in the subject [Program Engineering] (https://www.fer.hr).
We expect you to abide by the [IEEE Code of Ethics](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html) which has an important educational function with the purpose of setting the highest standards of integrity, responsible behaviour and ethical behaviour in professional activities. Thus, the professional community of software engineers defines general principles that define moral character, making important business decisions and establishing clear moral expectations for all members of the community.

A code of conduct is a set of enforceable rules that serve to clearly communicate expectations and requirements for community/teamwork. It clearly defines obligations, rights, unacceptable behaviour and corresponding consequences (in contrast to the code of ethics). One of the widely accepted codes of conduct for working in the open-source community is given in this repository.
